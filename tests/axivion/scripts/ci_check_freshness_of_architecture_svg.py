"""This script is intended for CI in order to check if the architecture is recent

It will check the change date of the architecture SVG in the documentation and
of all files that constitute input to this file and fail if the architecture
SVG is not newer (or at least equally) old as the other files.

In order to fix a failure, check the documentation on how to update the
architecture SVG.
