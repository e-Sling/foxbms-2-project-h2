|foxbms| now ships with a new conda environment ``2021-11-fennec-fox`` and the
local conda environment needs to be updated.

Added
=====

- Added enum typedef for GPIO pin state.
- Add driver for the temperature sensor *NTCLE317E4103SBA* from *Vishay*.
- Added documentation for Coulomb-counting and extended the documentation of
  the state-estimation-module.
- Added a define for ``NULL``.
- Make |git| a required software installation (see
  :ref:`SOFTWARE_INSTALLATION`).
- If a system-wide installation of |git| is not found in the build process,
  check for a user installation.
- Added an API to check whether a certain amount of milliseconds has passed.
- Added an API to the ``spi``-module that allows to check if the interface
  is available.
- Added a python script that can help with searching for regressions after
  resolving a complete violation category in Axivion.
- Automatically update the ``@updated`` doxygen comment before committing when
  pre-commit hooks are activated.
- Added documentation for the LTC based interface and slaves.
- In the ``spi``-module, hardware Chip Select pins can now be used.
  Until now only software Chip Select pins could be used.

Changed
=======

- Rewrote the linker script: the sections lengths are no longer hard-coded.
- The memory layout of ``OS_TASK_DEFINITION_s`` has been changed.
- The ``os``-module wrapper for task definition now also contains the
  ``pvParameters``.
- Static analysis cleanup of the ``os``-module and ``ftask``-module wrappers.
- Tasks are now marked as requiring FPU context, to prevent memory corruption
  during task switching.
- The Chip Select pin used to drive the external flash memory over SPI is now
  set as output with initial level high, corresponding to a default inactive
  state for the SPI line.
- Removed a hotfix that has been introduced in v1.0.0: the CAN driver used a
  critical section in order to avoid computation issues when scaling values.
  This has been shown to be connected with the FPU context and can now be
  removed as the root cause has been resolved.
- Updated the Axivion configuration to use version ``7.2.6``.
- Create the Axivion build directory before running the analysis.
- The documentation build now treats warnings as errors.
- Updated the doxygen configuration files to match the doxygen version that
  is shipped in the conda environment.
- Switched the used C standard to C11.
- The FreeRTOS specific implementations for the task and queue creation were
  moved into ``os_freertos.c`` and ``ftask_freertos.c``.
- Greatly enhanced the robustness and code quality of the driver for Maxim
  analog front ends.

Deprecated
==========

Removed
=======

Fixed
=====

- The error message when ``bms.json`` had an invalid configuration always
  indicated an invalid *analog front-end* configuration, independently of what
  option was actually invalid configured.
  The error message now correctly points to the setting, that sets an invalid
  configuration.
- Fixed several MISRA-C violations and style guide violations.
- Fixed the conda environment shell update script.
- The signature of the FreeRTOS tasks was not correct and has been fixed to
  match ``void TaskName(void *pvParameters)``.
- Explicitly cast the variables that are passed to the FreeRTOS task creation
  function.
- Make ``NULL_PTR`` explicitly *unsigned*.
- Fixed product number for the used trace probe in our test setup.
- Fixed incorrect values for GPIO measurement times in LTC module.
- Cleaned up ``spi``-module and added documentation.
  Removed unused enum (``SPI_INTERFACE_e``).
