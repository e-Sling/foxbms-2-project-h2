Changed
=======

- Finalize red-fox conda environment ``2021-04-red-fox`` based on
  ``red-fox-devel-020``. No packages are updated, just finalized the name.
- Removed dependency of configured power lines from overcurrent check in SOA
  module. The overcurrent is now checked against allowed cell, string and pack
  current limits.
- C source files, that are not vendored, are now ``ASCII`` encoded.
- Improved the code quality by adding assertions in various locations and
  removing unused code.
- Base decisions in ``bms`` on pack value database entry as this entry contains
  only validated values. Do not directly use current sensor measurements
  anymore.
- Fixed function names in the system monitoring module.
- Replace remaining ``TRUE`` and ``FALSE`` in embedded sources with ``true``
  and ``false`` respectively from ``stdbool.h``.
- Updated LLVM to version 11.0.1
- Only compile |foxbms| source and operating system sources in ``strict_ansi``
  mode
