 * @brief   Unit tests for the MCU startup routine of the bootloader on the TI
 *          TMS570Lx43xx
 * @details Testing the startup procedure of the MCU is a relatively complex
 *          unit test. The startup procedure needs to the read a register
 *          (esmREG.SR1[...] defined in MockHL_reg_esm.h) to run mitigation
 *          strategies in case of errors. As reading these registers on the
 *          host platform is of course not possible, a workaround is needed.
 *          The workaround requires configuration in
 *          'conf/unit/bootloader_project_win32.yml'.
 *          This test can not be run on Linux, therefore **no**
 *          configuration is required in
 *          'conf/unit/bootloader_project_posix.yml'.
 *          The esmREG is mocked through
 *          'tests/unit/bootloader/main/helper/mock_esm.h'. This requires, that
 *          the test does **not** include 'MockHL_reg_esm.h', but only the
 *          mocked 'mock_esm.h'. This is achived by providing the include guard
 *          of 'MockHL_reg_esm.h' as compiler argument
 *          (gcc ... -D__REG_ESM_H__ ...).
 *          This further requires, that in the driver implementation
 *          'fstartup.c' includes 'mock_esm.h' (guarded for only the unit test
 *          case) first. By that, and by providing '-D__REG_ESM_H__' the driver
 *          compiles for the target as well as for the unit test with the
 *          correct implementation.
 *          'mock_esm.h' just keeps a minimal type configuration, just detailed
 *          enough to mock all required registers, but not more.
 *          The function to get the reset source of the MCU
 *          (STU_GetResetSourceWithoutFlagReset) is not tested, as this is
 *          based on register values, that can not be reasonably mocked on the
 *          host. Therefore, this unit test includes just a dummy function to
 *          emulate STU_GetResetSourceWithoutFlagReset and enables by that to
 *          check all startup cases.
