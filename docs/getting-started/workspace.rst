.. _CREATING_A_WORKSPACE:

Creating a Workspace
====================

If |vs-code| is available, a ``.vscode`` directory with all needed
configurations is generated when running ``.\fox.ps1 waf configure``.
The generated workspace is properly configured.

Launching |vs-code|
-------------------

It is best to use the provided launcher script ``.\fox.ps1 ide`` to open
|vs-code| as then all environment variables are automatically correctly set.

If using |fox-py| is not desired the following steps need to be taken into
account:

#. All required build tools etc. need to be in path and environment variables
   need to be correctly set.
#. Open |vs-code|.
#. Goto ``File->Open Folder`` and select the cloned |foxbms| repository.

Build Tasks
-----------
Build commands are executed by running ``Build Tasks``.

A ``Build Task`` is executed either selecting ``Terminal->Run Build Task`` from
the menu or pressing :kbd:`Ctrl + Shift + B`.

A list of possible build commands is shown and the desired one can be executed
by clicking with the cursor or navigating with the arrow keys and pressing
:kbd:`Enter`.

Hints
-----

These are the default shortcuts in |vs-code|.
They can be adapted to fit the user's needs.

#. Jumping to definition: :kbd:`F12`
#. Show all references: :kbd:`Shift + F12`
#. Find file: :kbd:`Ctrl + P`
#. Open command palette: :kbd:`Ctrl + Shift + P`
#. Search within active file: :kbd:`Ctrl + F`
#. Search within whole project: :kbd:`Ctrl + Shift + F`
#. Run Build Tasks: :kbd:`Ctrl + Shift + B`
#. Open header file to active source file: :kbd:`Alt + O`
#. Navigate history: :kbd:`Ctrl + Tab`
