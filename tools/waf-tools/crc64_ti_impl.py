   SPNA235-August 2016
   Using the CRC Module on Herculesâ„¢-Based Microcontrollers

and the accompanying linked software examples (available at
http://www.ti.com/lit/zip/spna235).

The CRC function 'generate_crc_64_for_tms570_on_board_crc_calculation' is
implemented in Python based on the example code from 'CRC64_calc.c'
(which is part of http://www.ti.com/lit/zip/spna235).

'CRC64_calc.c' is released under the following license:
