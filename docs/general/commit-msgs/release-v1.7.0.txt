Minor release of foxBMS 2 (v1.7.0)

The installation process and the overall tooling has been simplified.
foxBMS 2 now ships with a new 'venv' environment named '2024-08-pale-fox'.
See INSTALLATION.md for information on updating the toolchain.

**The CAN message IDs and some internal definitions have been changed.**

* The defintion and layout of the CAN messages has been improved and required
  some changes.
  This is a incompatible change, i.e., control software needs to be adapted in
  order to correctly communicate with the BMS.
  See the changelog and documentation for details.
* Fixed several bugs in NXP MC33775A driver:
  - which was caused by a wrong stop condition when iterating over cell
    voltages in function 'N775_InitializeDatabase'.
  - which caused an out-of-bounce access when reading out the unique device ID
    in function 'N775_Enumerate'.
  - which caused the daisy-chain to be not initialized correctly in some cases.
    No measurement data could be read from the daisy-chain in these cases.
* Unit tests of the ADI ADES1830 AFE driver have been improved.
* Toolchain updates (see INSTALLATION.md on how to update):
  - The Python dependencies have been updated.
  - Ceedling has been updated to 1.0.0-ba45d2c.
  - The |ruby-gems| required for ceedling have been updated.
  - The VS Code workspaces have been improved for a better developed
    experience.
