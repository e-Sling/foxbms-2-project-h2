# ## Development
#
# This file is automatically parsed by GitLab for its correctness so that it
# can work.
# However, the rules we want to enforce on this file are purely stylistic (
# e.g., to ease the maintainability) or some testing logic (e.g., for every
# binary that is tested on the HIL, a SPA build shall exists too).
# As such things are notorious error prone, there is a script, that helps to
# ensure, that everything is well.
# This check script is of course run in CI.

# Ignore some strings, that are only used in this file
# cSpell:ignore cbtc, utnc, bccsv, utpb, spatt, spapb
# cSpell:ignore Werror, pubkey
# cSpell:ignore dbfile, confdir

# ## General setup

stages:
  # ### The job prefix is the derived from the stage name by the following rule:
  # split string by underscores and concatenate the first letter of each entry,
  # i.e., the prefix for the stage 'abc_def' becomes 'ad'.
  # Every stage needs to comment in a one-line comment what it does.
  - fox_install # check for basic software fox_installation
  - configure # check that the project can be configured

c_win32_ps1:
  # ### Windows pwsh.exe configuration of the build system
  stage: configure
  tags: [foxbms_tms570_bld]
  before_script: []
  script: .\fox.ps1 waf configure --verbose --color yes --zones=task_gen
